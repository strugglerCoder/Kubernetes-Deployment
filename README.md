## Overview

In this project, we focused on deploying and managing a containerized application using Kubernetes. Kubernetes provided us with a powerful platform for orchestrating containers, ensuring high availability, scalability, and ease of management.

## Deployment

We utilized Kubernetes Deployment for lifecycle management of our application. Deployment enables us to declaratively define the desired state of our application and Kubernetes ensures that the current state matches the desired state, scaling up or down as needed to maintain availability and performance.

## Interacting with Kubernetes

To interact with Kubernetes clusters, we leveraged the `kubectl` command-line tool. `kubectl` provided us with a convenient interface for managing various aspects of our Kubernetes environment, such as deploying applications, inspecting cluster resources, and troubleshooting issues.

## Docker Images

For deploying our application within the Kubernetes environment, we pulled Docker images from the Docker Hub registry. Docker images served as the building blocks for our containers, encapsulating our application code and dependencies in a portable and scalable format.

## Configuration Management

In Kubernetes, managing configuration data is essential for ensuring the security and flexibility of our applications. We employed the following techniques for configuration management:

### Secrets

Sensitive data such as credentials, API keys, and other configuration details were stored securely using Kubernetes Secrets. Secrets allow us to store and manage sensitive information in an encrypted format, ensuring that only authorized applications and users can access this data.

### ConfigMap

For storing non-sensitive configuration data in key-value pairs, we utilized Kubernetes ConfigMap. ConfigMap provided a flexible and scalable solution for managing configuration settings, allowing us to easily update and propagate configuration changes across our application.

## Kubernetes Service

We implemented Kubernetes Service for endpoint exposure, enabling seamless communication between microservices. Kubernetes Service acts as an abstraction layer that exposes a set of Pods as a network service, providing a stable endpoint for accessing the application internally or externally.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the power and flexibility of Kubernetes for deploying and managing containerized applications. By leveraging Kubernetes Deployment, `kubectl` command-line tool, Docker images, Secrets, ConfigMap, and Kubernetes Service, we were able to build a robust and scalable application infrastructure.
